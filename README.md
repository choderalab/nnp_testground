# nnp_testground


## Systems


- examples/waterbox contains simulation setup for a ~1K atom pure water simulation. Simulations are performed either with ANI2x or MACE.

- examples/protein_ligand contains a solvated protein-ligand simulation in which the ligand is treated with a NNP and the protein&water is treated with a classical force field.
